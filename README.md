# Overview

Map English names of village locations to their native names

## Process
This my thinking process

1. Get the key from the translator app for a village
2. Look up this key in GIS and get the max and min long and lat coordinates
3. Pass these coordinates into OSM to find the tags for the names of the village and hopefully find the native name there
